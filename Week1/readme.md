**C++ Programming Examples and Exercises**
This repository contains a series of C++ examples and exercises, focusing on classes, operators, templates, file handling, and data processing. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Complex Number Class
This code demonstrates how to define and use a Complex class to represent complex numbers. It includes:
**Constructor overloading
Operator overloading (addition and multiplication)
Member functions for accessing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Max Function Examples
This section includes several functions that find the maximum of two values, demonstrating function overloading and using reference and pointer arguments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generic Template Function
This section demonstrates a generic function template GetMax that works for any data type
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pair Template Class
The mypair template class is used to create pairs of values. It demonstrates the usage of class templates and member functions for finding the maximum value
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sequence Template Class
The MySequence template class handles sequences of a fixed size. It includes member functions for setting values, getting values, and finding the maximum and minimum values in a sequence
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Handling
This section shows file handling by reading from one file and writing to another. It also includes counting characters, words, and sentences in a text file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Student Grade Processing**
**This exercise processes student grades. It reads student information and computes averages, as well as finding the highest and lowest averages**
14. House Listing
The house listing program lets you input multiple houses' information and displays the details.
